                ETSU Tours is an application that is used to let anyone be able to safely walk across campus and see all the 
                buildings and learn about each one. We currently offer the main tour, letting you walk across campus and 
                see and learn about all the main buildings, but as we develop our tours, we will be offering more tours that 
                will let users like you experience a tour across a specific department. <br/>

            <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
            <p style="font-size:1.25em; padding:20px">
                Mobile app students and prospective students can use to tour the campus. By default, the tour
                will be the standard ETSU tour across all the main buildings. Specialized tours should also be supported
                where someone interested in a specific college can focus on what they offer. Additionally, tours specific
                to a department should be available. Non-academic tours will be offered around the history, art, and flora
                of the campus. Ultimately, the tour will know exactly where the person is and present content based on that 
                location. Additionally points of interest will have QR codes that can be scanned for non-tour content. <br/>
